## Overview
This skill helps you build a fully automated content pipeline that generates scroll-stopping scripts, produces realistic UGC-style videos with AI avatars, and schedules cross-platform posts on TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts — all without filming, editing, or manual scheduling. Use this when you need to publish daily (or multiple times daily) to grow faceless AI influencer accounts, drive product sales, app downloads, or website traffic with organic reach. The system reduces content production cost to 5-10% of traditional UGC hiring ($4,480–$11,200/month down to ~$300–$600/month) and enables consistent 14-video weekly output with minimal human intervention.

## Instructions
1. **Set up Claude Cowork:**
   - Download and install the Claude Desktop app from claude.com/download (macOS or Windows).
   - Subscribe to a paid plan (Pro $20/month, Max $100–$200/month, Team $30/user/month).
   - Open Claude Desktop, switch to “Cowork” mode.
   - Create a dedicated project folder (e.g., `~/TikTok-Content/`) and grant Cowork access.
   - Inside the folder, create an `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file with your brand voice, target audience demographics, and content pillars.
   - Enable Claude in Chrome connector to allow web browsing for trend research.

2. **Set up Arcads AI:**
   - Sign up at arcads.ai.
   - Choose a plan: Starter (€100/month = 10 videos), Creator (€200/month = 20 videos), or Pro (custom pricing with API access).
   - Browse and shortlist 3–5 AI actors matching your target demographic (e.g., mid-20s to early 30s professionals for B2C apps).
   - Test one video with a sample script to evaluate lip-sync, micro-expressions, and background quality.
   - If on Pro plan, generate your API key for programmatic access.

3. **Set up Postiz:**
   - Sign up at postiz.com or self-host via Docker from https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app.
   - Connect your TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, X, LinkedIn, and other platform accounts via the Integrations dashboard.
   - Install the Postiz CLI globally: `npm install -g postiz-cli`.
   - Set your API key: `postiz config set api-key YOUR_KEY`.
   - Verify setup: `postiz status`.

4. **Generate scripts with Claude Cowork:**
   - Research trends: Prompt Cowork with: “Research the top 20 trending TikTok videos in the [your niche] space this week. Analyze the common hooks, video formats, and engagement patterns. Save your findings to a file called trend-research.md in our project folder.”
   - Generate batch scripts: Prompt Cowork with: “Based on the trend research, generate 14 TikTok video scripts for the next two weeks. Each script should include: (1) A strong hook in the first 3 seconds, (2) Body content of 45–60 seconds, (3) A clear call-to-action. Save each script as a separate text file in /scripts/ folder, named by date and topic. Also create a content-calendar.csv with columns for date, topic, script file, target hashtags, and posting time.”
   - Optimize each script by asking for: 3 hook variations per script, emotional tone control (calm/urgent/casual), TikTok-native slang, and trending audio references.
   - Schedule recurring script generation: Type `/schedule` in Cowork, set recurrence to “every Monday at 8:00 AM”, and include the script generation prompt with reference to `trend-research.md`.

5. **Prepare scripts for Arcads AI:**
   - Ensure scripts are under 200 words for 60–90 second videos.
   - Write conversationally — avoid formal language.
   - Use ellipsis (...) or line breaks to indicate natural pauses.
   - Capitalize words for emphasis (e.g., “THIS is the secret”).
   - Save scripts as plain .txt files in `/scripts/`.

6. **Generate videos with Arcads AI:**
   - Log into arcads.ai and create a new project.
   - Paste or upload a script.
   - Select 1 of your pre-shortlisted AI actors.
   - Choose a background matching your niche (e.g., home office for productivity, gym for fitness).
   - Set emotion/tone (e.g., enthusiastic, calm, conversational).
   - Click Generate — wait ~2 minutes for rendering.
   - Download the MP4 file.
   - For scale: Use batch creation — prepare a CSV with multiple scripts, select 2–3 actors, and generate 10–20 videos in one session.

7. **Add post-production enhancements:**
   - Use CapCut (free) to add trending audio, animated captions, text overlays, split-screen effects, or branded intro/outro frames.
   - Ask Cowork to rename and organize downloaded video files into `/videos/` folder with consistent naming (e.g., `2026-03-15_productivity-tip.mp4`).

8. **Schedule and publish with Postiz:**
   - Use the Postiz CLI to schedule videos: `postiz schedule --file /videos/2026-03-15_productivity-tip.mp4 --platform tiktok --time "2026-03-15T08:00:00" --caption "Your caption here" --hashtags "#productivity #hustle #ai"`.
   - Cross-post to Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, LinkedIn, X, Reddit from the same command or dashboard.
   - Customize captions and hashtags per platform using Cowork-generated variations.
   - Set optimal posting times: 7–9 AM, 12–1 PM, and 7–10 PM in your audience’s timezone.
   - Enable auto-engagement in Postiz dashboard: Trigger likes/comments when a post reaches 500 views, 50 likes, or 10 comments.

9. **Track analytics and optimize:**
   - Weekly, export Postiz analytics to `analytics-weekXX.csv` and save it in your project folder.
   - Prompt Cowork: “Analyze the performance data in analytics-weekXX.csv. Identify the top 3 performing videos and what made them successful. Identify the bottom 3 and hypothesize why they underperformed. Use these insights to adjust next week's script batch. Focus more on the topics and hooks that drove the highest engagement.”
   - Run A/B tests: Test one variable at a time (hook, actor, posting time, caption) for 7+ posts per variation.
   - Use Cowork to analyze A/B results and generate revised scripts.

10. **Implement advanced automation (optional):**
    - Use n8n or Make.com to build a workflow:
      1. Weekly trigger (Monday 8 AM).
      2. Webhook triggers Cowork script generation.
      3. File watcher detects new scripts in `/scripts/`.
      4. Scripts sent to Arcads API (Pro plan required).
      5. Completed videos downloaded and uploaded to Postiz via CLI/API.
      6. Posts scheduled per `content-calendar.csv`.
    - Use Postiz CLI agent as a Cowork skill: Prompt Cowork with: “Generate 7 scripts for this week, create the videos, and schedule them to TikTok at optimal times.” Cowork will orchestrate the full pipeline.

11. **Scale your operation:**
    - Create separate project folders in Cowork for each niche/account.
    - Use Postiz’s multi-tenant architecture to manage client accounts separately.
    - Translate scripts into 35+ languages using Cowork, then generate localized videos in Arcads.
    - Repurpose top-performing scripts into blog posts, newsletters, Twitter threads, and LinkedIn articles using Cowork — schedule all via Postiz.

12. **Maintain quality and authenticity:**
    - Always review AI-generated videos before publishing — check for lip-sync glitches, unnatural expressions, or audio issues.
    - Intersperse AI content with 1–2 genuine human videos per week.
    - Personally respond to comments — use time saved by automation to deepen community engagement.

## Examples
- When the user asks about “how to generate 14 TikTok scripts in one go” → Do: Prompt Claude Cowork with: “Based on the trend research, generate 14 TikTok video scripts for the next two weeks. Each script should include: (1) A strong hook in the first 3 seconds, (2) Body content of 45–60 seconds, (3) A clear call-to-action. Save each script as a separate text file in /scripts/ folder, named by date and topic. Also create a content-calendar.csv with columns for date, topic, script file, target hashtags, and posting time.”
- When the user asks about “how to reduce video production cost” → Do: Use Arcads AI (€100–€200/month) instead of hiring UGC creators ($80–$200/video). At 14 videos/week, this saves $4,480–$11,200/month.
- When the user asks about “how to schedule videos across TikTok and Instagram” → Do: Use Postiz CLI: `postiz schedule --file video.mp4 --platform tiktok,instagram --time "2026-03-15T08:00:00"` and customize captions per platform using Cowork.
- When the user asks about “why are my videos not getting views” → Do: Check if you’re posting daily (algorithm requires daily output), if hooks are in first 3 seconds, if you’re using trending audio, and if you’re testing 3 hook variations per script. Run Cowork analysis on `analytics-weekXX.csv`.
- When the user asks about “can I automate the whole pipeline” → Do: Set up n8n workflow: Weekly trigger → Cowork script gen → Arcads API video gen → Postiz CLI upload/schedule. Or use Cowork’s Postiz CLI integration to execute full pipeline with one prompt.

## Framework
**End-to-End Automation Pipeline (3-Tool Stack):**
1. **Creative & Strategic Layer (Claude Cowork):**  
   - Researches trends via web browsing  
   - Generates batch scripts with hooks, body, CTA  
   - Creates content calendar (CSV)  
   - Optimizes tone, slang, audio references  
   - Schedules recurring script generation  
   - Analyzes analytics and adjusts strategy  
   - Repurposes content into blogs, threads, emails  
   - Translates scripts for multilingual expansion  

2. **Production Layer (Arcads AI):**  
   - Converts scripts into UGC-style talking-head videos  
   - Uses 300+ hyper-realistic AI actors  
   - Supports batch generation via CSV upload  
   - Adds lip-sync, micro-expressions, breathing motions  
   - Offers background settings (home office, gym, kitchen)  
   - Outputs MP4 files optimized for TikTok  
   - Supports 35+ languages with localization  

3. **Distribution & Measurement Layer (Postiz):**  
   - Schedules posts across 20+ platforms  
   - Cross-posts one video to TikTok, Reels, Shorts, X, LinkedIn, Reddit  
   - Tracks engagement, reach, follower growth, CTR  
   - Enables auto-engagement (likes/comments) at thresholds  
   - Provides CLI and API for automation (n8n, Make.com)  
   - Supports self-hosting (Docker)  
   - Integrates with Cowork via CLI agent  

**Relationships:**  
- Cowork → writes scripts → saved to `/scripts/` → Arcads reads → generates videos → saved to `/videos/` → Postiz CLI reads → schedules → analytics exported to `/analytics/` → Cowork analyzes → adjusts next batch.

## Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Over-relying on templates:**  
   - Why wrong: AI content becomes repetitive, loses algorithmic favor.  
   - Do instead: Cycle through formats — educational how-tos, opinion pieces, trend reactions, behind-the-scenes, myth-busting, storytelling.

2. **Ignoring platform-specific nuances:**  
   - Why wrong: TikTok hooks don’t work on YouTube Shorts; Instagram prefers longer captions.  
   - Do instead: Use Cowork to generate platform-specific captions and hashtags for each cross-post.

3. **Neglecting the human touch:**  
   - Why wrong: Audiences distrust fully automated accounts; engagement drops.  
   - Do instead: Post 1–2 genuine human videos per week and personally reply to comments.

4. **Not monitoring quality:**  
   - Why wrong: Lip-sync glitches, unnatural expressions, or audio issues reduce retention.  
   - Do instead: Build a manual review step — approve every video before scheduling.

5. **Assuming Arcads can demonstrate physical products:**  
   - Why wrong: AI actors cannot hold, open, or interact with real objects naturally.  
   - Do instead: Use real filmed footage for product demos; use Arcads only for testimonial-style or talking-head scripts.
